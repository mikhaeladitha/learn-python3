Some things I learned while studying data science in the Certified Independent Study program by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture

Certified Independent Study is part of the Merdeka Campus program which aims to provide opportunities for students to learn and develop themselves through activities outside the classroom, but are still recognized as part of the lecture. This program is intended for students who want to equip themselves by mastering specific and practical competencies that are also sought after by the industrial world.
